# libdsxx
C++ >=17 data structures library

This library implements intrusive and non-intrusive data structures in C++.
An introduction to intrusive data structures in both C and C++ (including
a contrast of the mechanisms available to each) can be found
[here](https://dcrisn.github.io/intrusive-data-structures-in-c-and-cpp/).

For a set of data structure implementations in C, see [here](https://github.com/dcrisn/libtarp/tree/main/include/tarp).
